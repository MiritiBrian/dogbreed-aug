# **Stanford Dogs Classification with Selected Breeds**

This project demonstrates the full pipeline of downloading a subset of the [Stanford Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset), splitting it into train and validation sets, applying image augmentations, and training a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify dog breeds.

## **1. Overview**

1. **Dataset**  
   - The project downloads the Stanford Dogs dataset from Kaggle (via `kagglehub`).
   - Only **10** dog breeds are selected for demonstration, creating a smaller dataset.
   - Each breed’s images are split into 80% for training and 20% for validation.

2. **Image Augmentation**  
   - We create two training data generators:
     - **Original** generator (no augmentation, just rescaling).
     - **Augmented** generator (applying random rotations, shifts, flips, etc.).  
   - A validation generator is used without augmentation, just rescaling.

3. **Model Architecture**  
   - A simple CNN is defined with 3 convolutional blocks followed by a fully connected head:
     1. Convolution → MaxPool
     2. Convolution → MaxPool
     3. Convolution → MaxPool
     4. Flatten → Dense → Dropout → Dense(num_classes)

4. **Training & Visualization**  
   - Trains the model for 10 epochs on the original data.  
   - (Optionally) can train a separate model on the augmented data.  
   - Accuracy and loss curves are plotted to show learning progress.

5. **Interpretation**  
   - Final plots demonstrate the model’s performance.  
   - Suggestions are given for improvement (more epochs, deeper model, or transfer learning).

## **2. Requirements**

- Python 3.x
- Kaggle credentials (to download via `kagglehub`)
- Major Python packages:
  - `kagglehub`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `tensorflow` / `keras`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `shutil`
  - `os`
  - `PIL` (usually included with Pillow, if needed by Keras)

Example install commands:
```bash
pip install kagglehub tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## **3. File/Directory Structure**

Assuming the repository contains:
```
project/
  ├── README.md                  <-- This file
  ├── main.py                    <-- Main Python script
  ├── smaller_dataset/           <-- Contains only 10 selected breed folders
  ├── train/                     <-- Split training set (automatically created)
  ├── val/                       <-- Split validation set (automatically created)
  └──
```

### **Key Directories**

1. **`smaller_dataset/`**  
   Where the selected 10 breed folders are copied to.  

2. **`train/`** and **`val/`**  
   After the split, each will have the same 10 breed subfolders.  

## **4. Step-by-Step Explanation of Code**

1. **Download Dataset with KaggleHub**  
   ```python
   path = kagglehub.dataset_download("jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset")
   ```
   - Downloads the Stanford Dogs dataset into a local directory.

2. **Select 10 Breeds**  
   ```python
   selected_breeds = [
       "n02085936-Maltese_dog",
       "n02086079-Pekinese",
       ...
   ]
   ```
   - Lists the breed folders to be retained.  

3. **Copying to a Smaller Directory**  
   ```python
   smaller_dataset_dir = os.path.join(path, "smaller_dataset")
   os.makedirs(smaller_dataset_dir, exist_ok=True)

   for breed in selected_breeds:
       source = os.path.join(path, "images/Images", breed)
       dest = os.path.join(smaller_dataset_dir, breed)
       shutil.copytree(source, dest)
   ```
   - Copies only the selected breed folders for demonstration.

4. **Splitting Train/Val**  
   ```python
   train_dir = os.path.join(path, 'train')
   val_dir   = os.path.join(path, 'val')
   os.makedirs(train_dir, exist_ok=True)
   os.makedirs(val_dir, exist_ok=True)

   for breed_folder in os.listdir(smaller_dataset_dir):
       ...
       # 80/20 split per breed, copying images into train_dir/breed and val_dir/breed
   ```
   - Each breed folder is split so both train and validation sets see the same 10 classes.

5. **Data Generators**  
   ```python
   original_train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1.0/255)
   augmented_train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
       rotation_range=30, width_shift_range=0.2, ...
   )
   val_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1.0/255)
   ```
   - Defines how images are loaded and transformed:
     - **Original**: only rescaling.
     - **Augmented**: random rotations, shifts, flips, etc.
     - **Validation**: only rescaling.

6. **Building and Training the CNN**  
   ```python
   def build_cnn(num_classes):
       model = models.Sequential([...])
       model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
       return model

   num_classes = len(original_train_generator.class_indices)
   model = build_cnn(num_classes)
   history = model.fit(original_train_generator, epochs=10, validation_data=val_generator)
   ```
   - Creates a simple CNN with a final dense layer equal to the number of classes.  
   - Trains for 10 epochs, monitoring validation performance.

7. **Visualization**  
   - A function (`visualize_augmentation`) compares the same images in original vs. augmented forms.  
   - Another function (`plot_training`) plots accuracy and loss over epochs.

## **5. Running the Project**

1. **Ensure Kaggle Credentials**  
   - Group 6 must have a `kaggle.json` file uploaded and permissions set so `kagglehub` can download.

2. **Install Requirements**  
   ```bash
   pip install kagglehub tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```

3. **Run the Main Script**  
   ```bash
   python code.py
   ```
   or inside a Jupyter notebook / Google Colab cell.

4. **Observe Outputs**  
   - The code will create `smaller_dataset/` (with selected breeds), then `train/` & `val/` subfolders.  
   - It will print how many images belong to each set.  
   - Plots will show up for augmentation examples and training curves.

## **6. Common Issues**

- **Shape Mismatch (target vs. output):**  
  Happens if `train_dir` and `val_dir` have different numbers of breed folders. Make sure both contain exactly the same set of classes.
- **Low Accuracy:**  
  If Group 6 see low accuracy, try:
  1. Increasing epochs.  
  2. Using a deeper model or a pretrained model (transfer learning).  
  3. Ensuring each breed has enough images.

## **7. Potential Improvements**

- **Transfer Learning:**  
  Use a pretrained network like VGG16 or ResNet for better feature extraction with fewer training samples.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
  Adjust learning rate, batch size, or use schedulers.
- **Data Balancing:**  
  If one breed has far more images, it may bias the model. Consider balancing the dataset or employing class weighting.

## **8. License & Credits**

- **Stanford Dogs Dataset**: Provided by [Kaggle / Jessica Li](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset). License information is typically in the Kaggle dataset description.  
- **Code**: Authored by Group 6. Feel free to adopt an open-source license like MIT or Apache 2.0.

# Tire/Dog Classification Project – An Evolving Monkey Analogy

Welcome to our project! In this repository, we train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images (in our case, dog breeds or tire textures) using both original and augmented data. To make things fun and memorable, we use the analogy of a monkey learning to sort objects into the correct baskets, evolving over time with the help of a coach. This README explains the code and training process step by step.

## 1. Downloading and Organizing the Dataset

### Code

```python
import os
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import random
import cv2
import shutil

from google.colab import files
files.upload()  # Upload your kaggle.json when prompted

import kagglehub

# Download the latest version of the dataset
path = kagglehub.dataset_download("jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset")
print("Path to dataset files:", path)

# Define the images directory
image_dir = os.path.join(path, 'images/Images')
print("Updated Images directory path:", image_dir)
print("Images available:", os.listdir(image_dir)[:10])  # Show first 10 images

# Select a smaller dataset: only 10 specific dog breeds
selected_breeds = [
    "n02085936-Maltese_dog",
    "n02086079-Pekinese",
    "n02086240-Shih-Tzu",
    "n02086910-papillon",
    "n02087046-toy_terrier",
    "n02087394-Rhodesian_ridgeback",
    "n02088094-Afghan_hound",
    "n02088238-basset",
    "n02088364-beagle",
    "n02088632-bluetick"
]

smaller_dataset_dir = os.path.join(path, "smaller_dataset")
os.makedirs(smaller_dataset_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Copy only the selected breed folders into the smaller dataset directory
for breed in selected_breeds:
    source_breed_dir = os.path.join(image_dir, breed)
    dest_breed_dir = os.path.join(smaller_dataset_dir, breed)
    shutil.copytree(source_breed_dir, dest_breed_dir)

# Define directories for training and validation datasets
train_small_dir = os.path.join(path, 'train_small')
val_small_dir   = os.path.join(path, 'val_small')
os.makedirs(train_small_dir, exist_ok=True)
os.makedirs(val_small_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Split each breed's images into 80% train and 20% validation
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

breed_folders = [f for f in os.listdir(smaller_dataset_dir) if os.path.isdir(os.path.join(smaller_dataset_dir, f))]
for breed in breed_folders:
    source_breed_path = os.path.join(smaller_dataset_dir, breed)
    images = [img for img in os.listdir(source_breed_path) if img.endswith(('.jpg','.jpeg','.png'))]
    
    train_files, val_files = train_test_split(images, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    
    train_breed_path = os.path.join(train_small_dir, breed)
    val_breed_path = os.path.join(val_small_dir, breed)
    os.makedirs(train_breed_path, exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs(val_breed_path, exist_ok=True)
    
    for img_file in train_files:
        shutil.copy(os.path.join(source_breed_path, img_file), os.path.join(train_breed_path, img_file))
    
    for img_file in val_files:
        shutil.copy(os.path.join(source_breed_path, img_file), os.path.join(val_breed_path, img_file))
```

### Monkey Analogy

- **Big Crate of Dogs:**  
  Our monkey receives a huge crate filled with dog images from the Stanford Dogs dataset. But to make his training manageable, we choose only 10 specific breeds (like selecting 10 types of tires with distinct textures) and create a smaller dataset.
  
- **Organizing the Baskets:**  
  The images are sorted into two sets: a training basket (`train_small_dir`) and a validation basket (`val_small_dir`). This helps our monkey practice sorting and then get tested on unseen images later.

---

## 2. Creating Data Generators

### Code

```python
# Define data generators for original, augmented, and validation images
original_train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1.0/255)
augmented_train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rescale=1.0/255,
    rotation_range=30,
    width_shift_range=0.2,
    height_shift_range=0.2,
    shear_range=0.2,
    zoom_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    fill_mode='nearest'
)
val_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1.0/255)

seed_val = 42
original_train_generator = original_train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    train_small_dir,
    target_size=(224, 224),
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='categorical',
    shuffle=False,
    seed=seed_val
)
augmented_train_generator = augmented_train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    train_small_dir,
    target_size=(224, 224),
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='categorical',
    shuffle=False,
    seed=seed_val
)
val_generator = val_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    val_small_dir,
    target_size=(224, 224),
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='categorical',
    shuffle=False
)

print("\nClass indices:", original_train_generator.class_indices)
```

### Monkey Analogy

- **Two Sets of Views:**  
  Our monkey gets two different sets of images:
  - **Natural View:** The original images of dogs in their natural state.
  - **Costumed View:** The same images, but transformed (rotated, shifted, etc.) so that the tires/dogs look different—a kind of "costume."
  
- **Batch Serving:**  
  Images are served in batches of 32, just like giving our monkey a small handful of tires to sort at a time. The fixed seed ensures he sees them in a consistent order every time.
  
- **Labeling the Baskets:**  
  The printed class indices tell us which folder corresponds to which numeric basket (e.g., Basket 0 is Maltese_dog, Basket 1 is Pekinese, etc.).

---

## 3. Visualizing Augmentation

### Code

```python
def visualize_augmentation(orig_gen, aug_gen, num_images=5):
    """
    Displays num_images from orig_gen (top row) and the corresponding
    augmented images from aug_gen (bottom row).
    Both generators should be aligned (same seed, shuffle=False).
    """
    orig_images, orig_labels = next(orig_gen)
    aug_images, aug_labels = next(aug_gen)
    
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, num_images, figsize=(5*num_images, 8))
    fig.suptitle('Original (top) vs. Augmented (bottom)', fontsize=16)
    
    for i in range(num_images):
        axes[0, i].imshow(orig_images[i])
        axes[0, i].axis('off')
        
        axes[1, i].imshow(aug_images[i])
        axes[1, i].axis('off')
    
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

visualize_augmentation(original_train_generator, augmented_train_generator, num_images=5)
```

### Monkey Analogy

- **Split-Screen Demo:**  
  Our monkey watches a split-screen video: the top row shows the natural dog images, and the bottom row shows them in various costumes (augmented images). This helps him understand that, despite the costumes, the core features remain the same.

---

## 4. Building and Training the CNN Model

### Code

```python
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

def build_cnn(num_classes):
    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(224, 224, 3)),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),

        layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),

        layers.Conv2D(128, (3,3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),

        layers.Flatten(),
        layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dropout(0.5),
        layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
    ])

    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

num_classes = len(original_train_generator.class_indices)
model_original = build_cnn(num_classes)
model_original.summary()

history_original = model_original.fit(
    original_train_generator,
    epochs=10,
    validation_data=val_generator
)

# Reset/Build a fresh model for augmented training
model_augmented = build_cnn(num_classes)
history_augmented = model_augmented.fit(
    augmented_train_generator,
    epochs=10,
    validation_data=val_generator
)
```

### Monkey Analogy

- **Designing the Brain:**  
  We build a CNN—our monkey's brain—where:
  - **Convolutional Layers:**  
    Different parts of his brain detect colors, edges, shapes, and textures (e.g., noticing that one dog is brown with a smooth coat versus another that is black with a rough texture).
  - **MaxPooling Layers:**  
    These allow him to take a quick glance and remember the strongest features from each small patch, so he doesn't get overwhelmed by minor details.
  - **Flatten Layer:**  
    He gathers all these clues into one big report.
  - **Dense Layers and Dropout:**  
    His decision-making center processes the report. Dropout forces him to not rely too heavily on one clue, ensuring balanced, robust decisions.
  - **Softmax Output:**  
    Finally, he "votes" on which basket (dog breed) the image belongs in, giving probabilities for each class.
  
- **Two Training Regimens:**  
  One model trains on the natural images (original) and another on the costumed images (augmented). This way, we can see how his training improves when he learns from varied conditions.

---

## 5. Plotting the Training History

### Code

```python
def plot_training(history, title):
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4))
    
    # Accuracy plot
    plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
    plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Train Acc')
    plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Val Acc')
    plt.title(f'{title} - Accuracy')
    plt.xlabel('Epochs')
    plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
    plt.legend()
    
    # Loss plot
    plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
    plt.plot(history.history['loss'], label='Train Loss')
    plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'], label='Val Loss')
    plt.title(f'{title} - Loss')
    plt.xlabel('Epochs')
    plt.ylabel('Loss')
    plt.legend()
    
    plt.show()

plot_training(history_original, "Original Data")
plot_training(history_augmented, "Augmented Data")
```

### Monkey Analogy

- **Reviewing the Report Card:**  
  After his training sessions, our monkey's coach gives him a report card:
  - **Accuracy Graph:**  
    This shows how often he correctly sorted the tires (or dog images) over each training day (epoch).
  - **Loss Graph:**  
    This indicates how many mistakes he made in his sorting.
- **Comparing Methods:**  
  By looking at the report cards for both the original and augmented training, we can see which training method helped our monkey learn better overall.

---

## Final Summary

1. **Dataset Organization:**  
   We download and organize the images into training and validation baskets.
2. **Data Generators:**  
   Our monkey receives batches of images, both in their natural form and in varied costumes (augmented), for training.
3. **Visualization:**  
   A split-screen demo shows the original versus augmented images, reinforcing the idea that core features remain constant.
4. **Model Building and Training:**  
   We construct a CNN (our monkey’s brain) to learn to sort images into the correct baskets. Two models are trained—one on original data and one on augmented data.
5. **Performance Evaluation:**  
   Training history is plotted to compare the performance (accuracy and loss) of both models.

This README file explains our entire training pipeline using a fun and relatable monkey analogy—detailing how each part of the code contributes to the overall learning process.

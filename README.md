# **Stanford Dogs Classification with Selected Breeds**

This project demonstrates the full pipeline of downloading a subset of the [Stanford Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset), splitting it into train and validation sets, applying image augmentations, and training a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify dog breeds.

## **1. Overview**

1. **Dataset**  
   - The project downloads the Stanford Dogs dataset from Kaggle (via `kagglehub`).
   - Only **10** dog breeds are selected for demonstration, creating a smaller dataset.
   - Each breed’s images are split into 80% for training and 20% for validation.

2. **Image Augmentation**  
   - We create two training data generators:
     - **Original** generator (no augmentation, just rescaling).
     - **Augmented** generator (applying random rotations, shifts, flips, etc.).  
   - A validation generator is used without augmentation, just rescaling.

3. **Model Architecture**  
   - A simple CNN is defined with 3 convolutional blocks followed by a fully connected head:
     1. Convolution → MaxPool
     2. Convolution → MaxPool
     3. Convolution → MaxPool
     4. Flatten → Dense → Dropout → Dense(num_classes)

4. **Training & Visualization**  
   - Trains the model for 10 epochs on the original data.  
   - (Optionally) can train a separate model on the augmented data.  
   - Accuracy and loss curves are plotted to show learning progress.

5. **Interpretation**  
   - Final plots demonstrate the model’s performance.  
   - Suggestions are given for improvement (more epochs, deeper model, or transfer learning).

## **2. Requirements**

- Python 3.x
- Kaggle credentials (to download via `kagglehub`)
- Major Python packages:
  - `kagglehub`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `tensorflow` / `keras`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `shutil`
  - `os`
  - `PIL` (usually included with Pillow, if needed by Keras)

Example install commands:
```bash
pip install kagglehub tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## **3. File/Directory Structure**

Assuming the repository contains:
```
project/
  ├── README.md                  <-- This file
  ├── main.py                    <-- Main Python script
  ├── smaller_dataset/           <-- Contains only 10 selected breed folders
  ├── train/                     <-- Split training set (automatically created)
  ├── val/                       <-- Split validation set (automatically created)
  └──
```

### **Key Directories**

1. **`smaller_dataset/`**  
   Where the selected 10 breed folders are copied to.  

2. **`train/`** and **`val/`**  
   After the split, each will have the same 10 breed subfolders.  

## **4. Step-by-Step Explanation of Code**

1. **Download Dataset with KaggleHub**  
   ```python
   path = kagglehub.dataset_download("jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset")
   ```
   - Downloads the Stanford Dogs dataset into a local directory.

2. **Select 10 Breeds**  
   ```python
   selected_breeds = [
       "n02085936-Maltese_dog",
       "n02086079-Pekinese",
       ...
   ]
   ```
   - Lists the breed folders to be retained.  

3. **Copying to a Smaller Directory**  
   ```python
   smaller_dataset_dir = os.path.join(path, "smaller_dataset")
   os.makedirs(smaller_dataset_dir, exist_ok=True)

   for breed in selected_breeds:
       source = os.path.join(path, "images/Images", breed)
       dest = os.path.join(smaller_dataset_dir, breed)
       shutil.copytree(source, dest)
   ```
   - Copies only the selected breed folders for demonstration.

4. **Splitting Train/Val**  
   ```python
   train_dir = os.path.join(path, 'train')
   val_dir   = os.path.join(path, 'val')
   os.makedirs(train_dir, exist_ok=True)
   os.makedirs(val_dir, exist_ok=True)

   for breed_folder in os.listdir(smaller_dataset_dir):
       ...
       # 80/20 split per breed, copying images into train_dir/breed and val_dir/breed
   ```
   - Each breed folder is split so both train and validation sets see the same 10 classes.

5. **Data Generators**  
   ```python
   original_train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1.0/255)
   augmented_train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
       rotation_range=30, width_shift_range=0.2, ...
   )
   val_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1.0/255)
   ```
   - Defines how images are loaded and transformed:
     - **Original**: only rescaling.
     - **Augmented**: random rotations, shifts, flips, etc.
     - **Validation**: only rescaling.

6. **Building and Training the CNN**  
   ```python
   def build_cnn(num_classes):
       model = models.Sequential([...])
       model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
       return model

   num_classes = len(original_train_generator.class_indices)
   model = build_cnn(num_classes)
   history = model.fit(original_train_generator, epochs=10, validation_data=val_generator)
   ```
   - Creates a simple CNN with a final dense layer equal to the number of classes.  
   - Trains for 10 epochs, monitoring validation performance.

7. **Visualization**  
   - A function (`visualize_augmentation`) compares the same images in original vs. augmented forms.  
   - Another function (`plot_training`) plots accuracy and loss over epochs.

## **5. Running the Project**

1. **Ensure Kaggle Credentials**  
   - You must have a `kaggle.json` file uploaded and permissions set so `kagglehub` can download.

2. **Install Requirements**  
   ```bash
   pip install kagglehub tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```

3. **Run the Main Script**  
   ```bash
   python code.py
   ```
   or inside a Jupyter notebook / Google Colab cell.

4. **Observe Outputs**  
   - The code will create `smaller_dataset/` (with selected breeds), then `train/` & `val/` subfolders.  
   - It will print how many images belong to each set.  
   - Plots will show up for augmentation examples and training curves.

## **6. Common Issues**

- **Shape Mismatch (target vs. output):**  
  Happens if `train_dir` and `val_dir` have different numbers of breed folders. Make sure both contain exactly the same set of classes.
- **Low Accuracy:**  
  If you see low accuracy, try:
  1. Increasing epochs.  
  2. Using a deeper model or a pretrained model (transfer learning).  
  3. Ensuring each breed has enough images.

## **7. Potential Improvements**

- **Transfer Learning:**  
  Use a pretrained network like VGG16 or ResNet for better feature extraction with fewer training samples.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
  Adjust learning rate, batch size, or use schedulers.
- **Data Balancing:**  
  If one breed has far more images, it may bias the model. Consider balancing the dataset or employing class weighting.
